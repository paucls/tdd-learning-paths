# TDD Learning Paths

Learning paths to develop your Test-Driven Development (TDD) skills gradually.

## Executive level
The Executive Level learning path provides a high-level overview of Test-Driven Development (TDD) for executives and decision-makers. TDD is not just a development technique; it is a philosophy that requires a cultural change. This path covers the fundamental concepts, benefits, and impact of TDD on software development. It equips executives with the knowledge to make informed decisions and support TDD adoption.

### Topics covered:
- TDD theory to understand exactly what is TDD and why consider adopting it.

### Learning path:
- Read TDD definition on Test-Driven Development (TDD) from [Test-Driven Development](https://www.codurance.com/test-driven-development-guide), Codurance.
- Take online course [What Is TDD and Why It Is Not Unit Testing: Executive Briefing](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/tdd-is-not-unit-testing-executive-briefing/table-of-contents) by Amy Dredge. Pluralsight. (32 min).
