# TDD Learning Paths

Learning paths to develop your Test-Driven Development (TDD) skills gradually.

## Executive level
The Executive Level learning path provides a high-level overview of Test-Driven Development (TDD) for executives and decision-makers. TDD is not just a development technique; it is a philosophy that requires a cultural change. This path covers the fundamental concepts, benefits, and impact of TDD on software development. It equips executives with the knowledge to make informed decisions and support TDD adoption.

### Topics covered:
- TDD theory to understand exactly what is TDD and why consider adopting it.

### Learning path:
- Read TDD definition on Test-Driven Development (TDD) from [Test-Driven Development](https://www.codurance.com/test-driven-development-guide), Codurance.
- Take online course What Is TDD and Why It Is Not Unit Testing: Executive Briefing by Amy Dredge. Pluralsight. (32 min).


## Beginner level
This path covers the foundations of TDD and progresses to more advanced concepts. It equips you with the necessary tools to effectively incorporate the TDD discipline into your software development projects.

### Topics covered:
